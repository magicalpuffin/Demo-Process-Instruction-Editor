# Demo Process Instruction Editor

The objective of this project is to create an extremely basic web application which allows the user to create and edit process instructions. These documents would consist of basic instructions as well as user defined data collection.

This project exists as a proof of concept and would only consist of a frontend. All data would be stored as local storage.
